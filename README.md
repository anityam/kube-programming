# Kube Programming
In this repo we will be programming different items in kubernetes cluster

## Exercise 1
### Learning about api
#### API 
Api is the central communication medium of the kubernetes cluster. Everything about kubernetes resources can be queried through the api calls.

#### Cluster
Create a kind cluster using this [config](./Kind/Config.yaml). In this we are exposing the local api endpoint at port ` 6443`. 

#### Hitting the endpoint
After the cluster is up we can query the api at `https://127.0.0.1:6443` 
```bash
curl https://127.0.0.1:6443
curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.
```

Since the api calls are protected by the https ssl verification we need to supply the cluster cert which is located in the `kind-control-plane` container
```bash
docker ps -a 

f574b704ad2   kindest/node:v1.27.3   "/usr/local/bin/entrâ€¦"   3 hours ago   Up 3 hours   127.0.0.1:6443->6443/tcp   kind-control-plane
```
so now grab the `ca.crt` of the cluster from the pod and place it in the cert folder

```bash
docker cp kind-control-plane:/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt cert/
```
With this you will get a `ca.crt` in the cert directory( which is omitted from this repo for obvious reason). 
```bash
curl --cacert cert/ca.crt  https://127.0.0.1:6443/version
